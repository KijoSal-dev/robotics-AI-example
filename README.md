This project demonstrates simple teleoperation of a robot using Python's `turtle` graphics module. The robot is represented by a turtle icon that can be controlled interactively with the keyboard arrow keys.

## Features

- Move the robot forward and backward
- Turn the robot left and right
- Visual feedback using the turtle graphics window

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Run the teleoperation demo:

   ```sh
   python teleoperations.py
